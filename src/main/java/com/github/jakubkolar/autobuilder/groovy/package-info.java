/**
 * Integration with the <a href="http://groovy-lang.org/"><i>Groovy</i></a> language.
 *
 * <p> All classes specific to the <i>Groovy</i> support of the <i>AutoBuilder</i> library
 * are located in this package. All <em>public</em> classes in this package are treated as
 * an API, with the same restrictions and guarantees as interfaces and classes from the <a
 * href="../api/package-summary.html">api package</a>.
 *
 * <p> <b>Important note:</b> To use the features from this package you will need to make
 * sure to have the <i>Groovy</i> jar on your classpath. <i>AutoBuilder</i> does not
 * depend on it directly in order not to transitively bring the dependency to projects not
 * using <i>Groovy</i>.
